        A cuisine is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients, techniques and dishes, and usually associated with a specific culture or geographic region. 
        Regional food preparation techniques, customs, and ingredients combine to enable dishes unique to a region.[1]

A cuisine is partly determined by ingredients that are available locally or through trade. 
Regional ingredients are developed and commonly contribute to a regional or national cuisine, such as Japanese rice in Japanese cuisine.
 Likewise, the most popular cuisines in the world include Indian cuisine, Chinese cuisine, Mexican cuisine, Greek and Italian cuisines.

            Going further, the Rajma of Chinta Valley in Doda district, a short distance from the town of Bhaderwah of Jammu province are said to be amongst the most popular.

        <h2 class="desc">PAAV BHAAJI</h2></DIV>
        <P class="TEXT">Pav bhaji is a spiced mixture of mashed vegetables in a thick gravy served with bread. Vegetables in the curry may commonly include potatoes, onions, carrots, chillies, peas, bell peppers and tomatoes.
             Street sellers usually cook the curry on a flat griddle (tava) and serve the dish hot. 
            A soft white bread roll is the usual accompaniment to the curry, but this does not preclude the use of other bread varieties such as chapati, roti or brown bread.</P>
